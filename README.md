About

This project is an AI-powered YouTube Video Summarizer built using Google Gemini and Streamlit.

The application allows users to paste a YouTube video link, automatically extracts the video transcript using the YouTube Transcript API, and generates a concise, well-structured summary in bullet points using Gemini 2.5 Pro. The summary captures the most important concepts from the video within a defined word limit, making it ideal for learning, revision, and note-taking.

Key features include:

Automatic YouTube video ID extraction (supports multiple URL formats)

Transcript extraction using YouTube Transcript API

High-quality summarization using Gemini LLM

Bullet-point, structured summaries within a word limit

Video thumbnail preview

Secure API key handling via environment variables

Clean and interactive Streamlit user interface

This project demonstrates practical application of LLMs for content summarization, educational tools, and productivity automation, making it a strong addition to AI engineering and data science portfolios.
